 I specialize in Cloud-Native and Kubernetes. I’m also a Free/Open source enthusiast. My favorite topics are DevOps transformation, automation, data, and metrics.

 I leverage continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), and automation to ensure seamless, reliable, and secure software delivery. Whether it’s optimizing cloud infrastructure, automating deployments, or improving system reliability, my focus is on driving innovation and operational excellence.
